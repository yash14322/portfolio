# Yeshwanth Surisetty — Flashy Portfolio (Static)

This is a ready-to-upload static portfolio website (HTML/CSS/JS).

## Files included
- index.html
- styles.css
- script.js
- images/profile.jpg (your profile photo)
- README.md (this file)

## How to publish on GitHub Pages (step-by-step)
1. Create a GitHub repo named e.g. `portfolio`.
2. On the repo page click **Add file → Upload files** and upload everything from this folder.
3. Commit changes.
4. Go to **Settings → Pages**. Under **Build and deployment** select **Deploy from a branch** and choose `main` as branch and `/ (root)` as folder. Save.
5. GitHub will provide a URL like `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO/` — this is your live site.

## Customize
- Replace project links: edit the `href` of `.project-link` anchors in `index.html`.
- Replace resume: upload a `resume.pdf` to the repo root to enable the Download Resume button.
- Replace profile image: overwrite `images/profile.jpg` with a new image (400x400 recommended).
